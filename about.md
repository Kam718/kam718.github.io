I work in IT and am interested in both Cyber Security and AI. This site is more of a personal journey that I can look back at and see all the things I've learned along the way. News stories on Cyber Security will be linked, projects I work on from Youtube or Twitch will be mentioned, and Github projects will also be talked about.

Cyber Security - A topic that is an "everyone" problem to resolve. It is the responsibilty for everyone, not just IT, to notice any issues or problems that impacts your daily life. The other day, I was in line at a business while a mom and son were talking behind me. I was there using my phone to research something. Then I overheard the son talk to a customer support represenative and gave out 3 pieces of information out loud in a crowd of around 20 people. The information he said would easily give anyone the chance to use it for identify theft purposes. People shouldn't be doing things like this. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) - This is my personal opinion. AI should be used as a tool to enhance a job role and not replace it. I don't think that a combination of AI/Machine Learning (ML)/ robotics should be sought after to make a hamburger at a resturant that has 5 people total that work there in a 24 hour shift. Imagine a world where a device like Microsoft's Hololens is used by a repair technician examining a business printer. They are given a diagram of some obscure part and how to get that to verify that it is working correctly. Not only that... they can see this in real time and animated. This would reduce time for support calls and even a remote tech would be able to help the original tech if needed for brainstorming. Also, this would help the warehouse to have the correct part ready for pickup. If anything, this would be an opportunity for someone that is tasked with delivering items for the original tech. 


Hopefully, I can have some impact to help my beliefs come true... Let's find out if I'm right.
